# libevdev

This folder contains Android build configuration for [libevdev](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libevdev/). The source code itself is included as a Git submodule, but a few extra header files are needed.

## Generating `include/config.h`

This file must exist but can be left empty by default.

```bash
touch include/config.h
```

## Generating `include/event-names.h`

This file is autogenerated from the embedded `linux/input.h` with the following command:

```bash
python source/libevdev/make-event-names.py source/include/linux/input.h > include/event-names.h
```

This command should be run every time the submodule is updated.
